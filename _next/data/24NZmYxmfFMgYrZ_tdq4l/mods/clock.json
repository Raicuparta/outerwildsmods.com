{"pageProps":{"readme":"# OWClock\nThis mod adds a clock overlay to Outer Wilds. It can be set to count up, or down to the sun exploding.\n\nThere's also an additional event logging system; upcoming events defined in `events.json` are displayed above the clock, turning red as they approach.\nNew events can be added from the pause menu (timestamp will be set to the current loop time).\n\n## Options\n - Count Up: Counts the elapsed seconds and minutes. When off, will count down to events/the end of the loop\n - Milliseconds: For speedrunners; uses millisecond timestamps\n - Events to Display: Number of upcoming events to display\n - Event List Width: Fraction of the available resolution that the event list can take up\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES\nRunning this during more intensive moments seem to sometimes cause a BSOD with CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (At least on my PC). If anyone has this issue (or a solution), please let me know.\n","externalImages":{},"mod":{"downloadUrl":"https://github.com/clubby789/OWClock/releases/download/0.4.0/Release.zip","downloadCount":1491,"repo":"https://github.com/clubby789/OWClock","manifest":{"filename":"Clock.dll","author":"clubby789","name":"Clock","uniqueName":"clubby789.OWClock","description":"Adds a clock overlay and eventlist","version":"0.4.0","owmlVersion":"0.7.3"},"version":"0.4.0"}},"__N_SSG":true}
