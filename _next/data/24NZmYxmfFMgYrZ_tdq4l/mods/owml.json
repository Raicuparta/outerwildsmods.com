{"pageProps":{"readme":"# Outer Wilds Mod Loader\n\nOWML is the mod loader and mod framework for Outer Wilds. It patches Outer Wilds to load mods, and provides mods a framework to interact with the game. OWML is inspired by SMAPI for Stardew Valley.\n\n## How it works\n\nOWML does the following:\n1. Patches the game to make it call the mod loader.\n2. Starts the game.\n3. The mod loader loads and initializes installed mods.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith Outer Wilds Mod Manager (recommended):\n1. Download the Mod Manager from the [Outer Wilds Mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/) website.\n2. Use the Mod Manager to install OWML and mods, and start the game.\n\nManual install:\n1. Download OWML and extract the zip file anywhere you want.\n2. [Download Outer Wilds mods](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods) and put them in the Mods folder, each mod in a separate folder.\n3. Start the game with OWML.Launcher.exe.\n\n## For modders\n\nRefer to the sample mods in the source code for examples. These mods are not included in releases.\n\n### Get started\n\n1. Create a C# class library project targeting .Net Framework 3.5.\n2. Install the [OWML Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OWML/).\n3. Reference the following files in {gamePath}\\OuterWilds_Data\\Managed:\n    * Assembly-CSharp.dll\n    * UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll\n    * More Unity DLLs if needed\n4. Inherit from ModBehaviour.\n\t\nFor more info, see [For modders](https://github.com/amazingalek/owml/wiki/For-modders).\n\n## Configuration\n\nOWML is configured in the in-game MODS menu, or in OWML.Config.json:\n\n|Key|Description|\n|---|-----------|\n|gamePath|The path to the game files. OWML will try to locate the game automatically.|\n|debugMode|If enabled, a lot more information is written to the console. Intended for developers.|\n|combinationsBlockInput|If this is true, mod input combinations will block game input.|\n\nEach mod is defined in a manifest.json file:\n\n|Key|Description|\n|---|-----------|\n|filename|The filename of the DLL containing the ModBehaviour class.|\n|author|The name of the author.|\n|name|The name of the mod.|\n|uniqueName|Usually {author}.{uniqueName}.|\n|version|The version number.|\n|owmlVersion|The version of OWML the mod was built for.|\n|dependencies|Array of dependency names. Make sure to use the unique name.|\n\nEach mod can be configured in the in-game MODS menu, or in config.json:\n\n|Key|Description|\n|---|-----------|\n|enabled|Whether or not the mod will be loaded. Default: true.|\n|requireVR|Whether or not the mod requires VR to work. Default: false.|\n|settings|An object of mod-specific settings.
